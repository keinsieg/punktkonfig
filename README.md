> My personal dotfiles â€“ minimal, fast, and portable.  
> Built for real Linux systems. Inspired by antiX â€“ no bloat.

`punktkonfig` is my dotfile setup: version-controlled, Unix-first, and tuned for speed and simplicity.  
It reflects how I actually work â€” with lean systems, real terminals, and window managers that stay out of the way.

I use this daily on real Linux installs (mostly antiX or similar).

## What's Inside

- **Shells** â€“ `bash` and `nushell` with aliases, clean prompts, and useful functions  
- **Editor** â€“ Emacs, configured for fast Lisp dev: themes, tweaks, and functions  
- **Terminals** â€“ Colorful, readable setups for `Kitty` and `Sakura`  
- **Git** â€“ Smart aliases, better diffs, readable logs  
- **Window Managers** â€“ Custom configs for:
  - `Xmonad` (Haskell)
  - `Qtile` (Python)
  - `fluxbox` / `fvwm` (lightweight classics)  
- **Scripts** â€“ Utilities for syncing, bootstrapping, tweaking â€” still growing

## Goals

- Fast on old hardware  
- Modular and easy to tweak  
- Clean configs with no magic  
- Distraction-free and functional  
- Linux-only â€“ tested on bare metal
